## Note : Fist add the roles.json by the Database Seeding in the mongo db Database 


## Overview

This project is a full-stack application built with React.js for the frontend and Node.js with Express and MongoDB (using Mongoose) for the backend. It provides a modern user interface and a robust backend API to support application functionality.

## Frontend

### Technology Stack

- **Framework:** React.js
- **Styling:**  CSS Modules / Material-UI (specify your choice)
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit 
- **API Communication:** Axios / Fetch API

### Setup and Installation

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. The frontend will be available at:
   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Folder Structure

## Backend

### Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Node.js with Express
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Authentication:** JWT (if applicable)
- **Environment Management:** dotenv

### Setup and Installation

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```plaintext
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=<Your MongoDB connection string>
   JWT_SECRET=<Your secret key>
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
5. The backend API will be available at:
   [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### Folder Structure

```plaintext
backend/
|-- models/             # Mongoose schemas and models
|-- routes/             # API routes
|-- controllers/        # Route logic and business logic
|-- middleware/         # Authentication and other middleware
|-- utils/              # Helper functions
|-- app.js           # Entry point of the application
```

### Key Features

- RESTful API endpoints
- MongoDB integration with Mongoose schemas
- Middleware for authentication and error handling
- Scalable structure for additional features

## Running the Full Application

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run start
   ```
2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```
3. Access the application at:
   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:9001)

## Environment Variables

Both frontend and backend require environment variables to function correctly. Ensure to configure them as specified.

### Frontend

- API\_BASE\_URL: The base URL of the backend server.

### Backend

- PORT: Port number for the backend server.
- MONGO\_URI: MongoDB connection string.
- JWT\_SECRET: Secret key for JWT authentication.
